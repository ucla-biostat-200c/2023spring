## Q1. Reivew of linear models 
### The swiss data â€” use Fertility as the response to practice
- An initial data analysis that explores the numerical and graphical characteristics of the data.

- Variable selection to choose the best model.

- An exploration of transformations to improve the fit of the model.

- Diagnostics to check the assumptions of your model.

- Some predictions of future observations for interesting values of the predictors.

- An interpretation of the meaning of the model by writing a scientific abstract. (<150 words)

  + BACKGROUND: brief intro of the study background, what are the existing findings
  
  + OBJECTIVE: state the overall purpose of your research, e.g., what kind of knowledge gap you are trying to fill in
  
  + METHODS: study design (how these data were collected), outcome definitions, statistical procedures used
  
  + RESULTS: summary of major findings to address the question raised in objective
  
  + CONCLUSIONS:


## Q2. Concavity of logistic regression log-likelihood 

### Q2.1

Write down the log-likelihood function of logistic regresion for binomial responses.

### Q2.2

Derive the gradient vector and Hessian matrix of the log-likelhood function with respect to the regression coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. 

### Q2.3

Show that the log-likelihood function of logistic regression is a concave function in regression coefficients $\boldsymbol{\beta}$. (Hint: show that the negative Hessian is a positive semidefinite matrix.)

## Q3.
